# PROBABILTY AND STATISTICS

# Project Summary

This project implements key probability and statistics concepts in R, such as generating and completing joint distributions, computing marginal distributions, covariances, conditional probabilities, and testing independence. It also visualizes 3D joint distributions and verifies density functions and Fubiniâ€™s Theorem using numerical integration.
